Early Concept for SRC Folder
----------------------------

/src/ajtcl 
will be autogenerated by a script that pulls the alljoyn sdk and dumps common ajtcl files here.
For now I'm just checking in the files.  A diff will reveal that I've changed some of the #includes from carats to quotes to simplify the build.  We'll have to work through that, but in general don't edit these files without discussing with the team (we aren't forking ajtcl!)

/src/<platform> 
will contain platform specific source files, these may be similar to the /targets/ files in the ajtcl source tree.  Will also contain the cordova shim layer.  Do whatever you want to here.
